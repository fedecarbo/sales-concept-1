## Jo / Fede \- Transcript

### 00:00:00

   
**Fede Carbo:** Nice. Okay, cool. Yeah, go ahead.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Okay. So, I would want to see um conversations through as many  
**Fede Carbo:** Sorry.  
**Jo Oliveira:** different channels that I use for that one person. So, we're talking about one person, whether it's a prospect or a client or um anybody that I want to reach out to. Um so, I could be having conversations in LinkedIn, for example. and also sales navigator. Do you know the difference between the standard LinkedIn platform and sales navigator?  
**Fede Carbo:** I don't think we talked about sales navigator, did we?  
**Jo Oliveira:** It's it's it's like another it's a sales platform that um you  
**Fede Carbo:** Uhhuh.  
**Jo Oliveira:** can subscribe to through LinkedIn, but it's actually a separate it uses the same data in a lot of ways, but it's a little bit more fine-tuned to sales and it has a separate  
**Fede Carbo:** Oh, I  
**Jo Oliveira:** um mail feature in Sales Navigator to LinkedIn.  
**Fede Carbo:** see.  
**Jo Oliveira:** So if you send a message to someone in Sales Navigator that you haven't connected with yet, for example, it would be useful to be able to bring that and the LinkedIn conversations once you have connected, plus any emails, maybe any phone conversation notes.  
   
 

### 00:01:20

   
**Jo Oliveira:** Um, even Slack, which doesn't happen quite so often for me, but others might. Um,  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** where else might I have a conversation? Yeah, even in person, you know,  
**Fede Carbo:** All right.  
**Jo Oliveira:** if I've um had a meeting in person, obviously I'd have to keep the notes from that. So, it would be stuff. It'd be a mixture of conversations um from various places plus my own notes.  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah, probably in person is a bit  
**Jo Oliveira:** Not always because I I if I have a face to face meeting with somebody,  
**Fede Carbo:** difficult.  
**Jo Oliveira:** I still capture the notes. It's like um in our CRM, that's where I cap capture that. We use copper. So that has a feature that you can add notes and meeting  
**Fede Carbo:** And when when So, let's say you have an inerson, I don't know,  
**Jo Oliveira:** updates.  
**Fede Carbo:** you go in person and you meet someone. When do you add those  
**Jo Oliveira:** Straight away of course.  
**Fede Carbo:** notes?  
**Jo Oliveira:** No, probably.  
   
 

### 00:02:19

   
**Jo Oliveira:** Well, I mean I have been uh on occasions had a face tof face meeting quickly write something up. You can't obviously do it at the same time always because it's a bit a bit rude. If it's a formal meeting,  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** then it's okay if you take notes. But um yeah,  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** so I probably would capture it electronically on my phone on a um digital notepad and then paste it into  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** copper. Um, if I was being very, you know, efficient, I would always record everything, but not everything's recorded.  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah. That's what we heard that we don't we're not going to be especially when it's just  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** an initial call or those things people don't feel comfortable with  
**Jo Oliveira:** No,  
**Fede Carbo:** recording.  
**Jo Oliveira:** not recording. But I mean, I do Yeah, I never record a meeting.  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** I don't know. Some people have the the transcript thing.  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** I mean, I've been in meetings before and they've transcribed and not asked me.  
   
 

### 00:03:21

   
**Jo Oliveira:** I think you have to ask people first if you do that.  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Anyway, you're going to have like all sorts of notes and conversations all over the place. It will be amazing to see all that in one  
**Fede Carbo:** So we have let's say we have a widget for that.  
**Jo Oliveira:** interface.  
**Fede Carbo:** Okay. uh and we can we can see I mean just imagine I'll show you like for example like like we can have any kind of content right I want to I mean it doesn't need to be perfect but I want to kind of bring your your journey to life so um if if you add a widget let's say how would you see for example the information of the conversations. It's a difficult question because it's hard  
**Jo Oliveira:** chronologically would be useful.  
**Fede Carbo:** to  
**Jo Oliveira:** The latest stuff first.  
**Fede Carbo:** right.  
**Jo Oliveira:** I don't know how visually that would look to be honest,  
**Fede Carbo:** And yeah,  
**Jo Oliveira:** but  
**Fede Carbo:** I mean I'm so I guess there's many different ways to show something uh right because it could be like the raw conversations, it could be summary of the  
   
 

### 00:04:43

   
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah, true.  
**Fede Carbo:** conversations,  
**Jo Oliveira:** Summary would be would be useful.  
**Fede Carbo:** a summary of I guess well if you would see a summary, what would that summary how would you imagine? in a  
**Jo Oliveira:** I it would be useful just to see any decision points or  
**Fede Carbo:** summary.  
**Jo Oliveira:** any like future follow-up reminders tasks. I I mean I can do that at the moment in copper. Can I add a task for have a conversation with somebody and they say, "Oh, now's not a good time. Maybe in a couple of months time." So I'll set myself a reminder to reach out then.  
**Fede Carbo:** Oh,  
**Jo Oliveira:** So that would be useful.  
**Fede Carbo:** well that's So we have another widget which is reminders.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yep. Or tasks or Yeah,  
**Fede Carbo:** Oh, tasks. Yeah, wait.  
**Jo Oliveira:** same thing  
**Fede Carbo:** Tasks.  
**Jo Oliveira:** really.  
**Fede Carbo:** Reminders.  
**Jo Oliveira:** And I don't want to get off track here,  
**Fede Carbo:** Nice.  
**Jo Oliveira:** but also company insights. A lot of um interesting stuff happening in the world of AI at the moment of gathering insights and signals on the company.  
   
 

### 00:05:53

   
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** So not necessarily related directly to a person but for the company that they're at the organization that they work for. Um, yeah, just get gaining as much insight as possible and possible like buying signals related to what we're selling. This is probably a whole other conversation,  
**Fede Carbo:** No, that's absolutely fine.  
**Jo Oliveira:** but  
**Fede Carbo:** So, what do you mean? Like, can you give me an example of a buying signal?  
**Jo Oliveira:** so say it's a scaleup company. Um, we know that they've got in-house teams, but they're growing really quickly. They're not at the point yet where they are going to hire anybody new. So at that point they might look to external suppliers to help deliver the ideas that they've got or you know keep keep projects moving to augment their team or to to um separately run a project with.  
**Fede Carbo:** How do you do it today? Like how do you find those things today?  
**Jo Oliveira:** Well,  
**Fede Carbo:** I mean if if you do if it's  
**Jo Oliveira:** yeah. I mean, we lots of different ways really, but the last year or two, we've been using um we've been trying out different um products really to do that.  
   
 

### 00:07:14

   
**Jo Oliveira:** Apollo being one. I think Hammed mentioned Apollo the other day. Happy to have a another conversation with you guys separately about the sorts of things that those types of  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** platforms do. Um, also Shayla, you know, our intern, she's working on um an insight kind of  
**Fede Carbo:** Mhm.  
**Jo Oliveira:** process using clay. It's another AI tool. It does lots of it does lots of things, but you can also use it to sort of capture like buying signals and insights about different companies and kind of score them really if they're a good fit or if they're worthwhile reaching out to just based on things like um yeah,  
**Fede Carbo:** Mhm.  
**Jo Oliveira:** like I said, if they're sort of scaling or if they've just received funding um if there's been a shift in senior management. You know, there's lots of different things that might kind of spark an opportunity. And it's,  
**Fede Carbo:** Mhm.  
**Jo Oliveira:** as you can imagine, really, really, really hard with just one salesperson in a in a company like ours to try to try and keep an eye on everything and look for opportunities before they've been announced.  
   
 

### 00:08:34

   
**Fede Carbo:** So, how would you call that signal? Sorry, that's uh what  
**Jo Oliveira:** Um, you could either call it like company insights or signals is is  
**Fede Carbo:** you  
**Jo Oliveira:** like the the official term for it really. Buying signals.  
**Fede Carbo:** Right. So I guess I'm imagining that this is a com like a a page to see one specific person, right? Like one Okay. Well, you can select from different I guess and and it will just like switch.  
**Jo Oliveira:** I mean,  
**Fede Carbo:** That could be another thing.  
**Jo Oliveira:** yeah, it would be it's always useful to see a company view and also an individual within that company because you're having conversations with people at the end of the day. Um, but you also want to see you might be having conversations with two or three different people in the same organization. hopefully they all know about the other conversations, but there's been times when I've just reached out to like a few people and just to see what will happen. Um, you know, you got to have thick skin because most of the time people just ignore you.  
   
 

### 00:09:44

   
**Jo Oliveira:** So, you got to keep trying. If there's a company that you really want to work with, um, you try different um,  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** strategies.  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah. And I guess the conversation history might cover those two or three people, right?  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah. Kind of. Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** So from a from a company lens.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah. Yeah, that's  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah,  
**Jo Oliveira:** true.  
**Fede Carbo:** I guess that's the difficult bit, right? It's like do we show it from a company lens or do we show it from an individual lens,  
**Jo Oliveira:** Depends on the sales strategy. So,  
**Fede Carbo:** right?  
**Jo Oliveira:** we're we're at Unboxed. We're trying out accountbased marketing at the moment. We was just trying to work out the best process for it really. So that's where you you do you look at the company, you really digging into the company and then you start looking at the people within it and who best to talk to. Um and you'd have different outreach messaging for each person really.  
   
 

### 00:10:40

   
**Jo Oliveira:** It'd be personal um to that individual but not  
**Fede Carbo:** Mhm.  
**Jo Oliveira:** too personal.  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah. Yeah. Nice. What else? Okay. So, what I put in my notes is it's it's kind of a history of  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** conversation  
**Jo Oliveira:** And if we're talking about AI here, a next step, you know, a suggested angle for the next kind of um perhaps  
**Fede Carbo:** which I think this one covers it might cover it right which is like tasks and next steps I guess.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah, because it's you need you want to be proactive. Um, and you want to be enticing as well, you know, you want to try and show the person that you're reaching out to that you're going to that what you're the reason why you want to have a conversation is because it's some value to  
**Fede Carbo:** Mhm.  
**Jo Oliveira:** them.  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah. Um yeah and again this prototype might not cover most of the needs I guess because the more I think of like creating this kind of let's say workfl or whatever like canvas there's some things that it's like how how do we make it like zoom in and out in a way.  
   
 

### 00:12:06

   
**Jo Oliveira:** Right. Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** Um but that's that's another I guess that's another story.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** So, so we have like um next next steps  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** tasks  
**Jo Oliveira:** Or suggested conversation starter or something like that depending on what stage you're at with them. If it's early stage, it's always good to have a bit of a kick start,  
**Fede Carbo:** just  
**Jo Oliveira:** you know, of like which what's what's the best way to start engaging?  
**Fede Carbo:** Right. Okay. So, yeah. So, that's that's the things that I that I'm like, hm, will this approach work well? Because let's say let's say okay, we uh that's a suggested conversation. So, let let's say I select the suggested conversation. Should it take me to an a different canvas that has already like an email workflow or  
**Jo Oliveira:** Um,  
**Fede Carbo:** or do we do it here kind of thing?  
**Jo Oliveira:** I think I keep it in one one view.  
**Fede Carbo:** The problem is that it's going to be start accumulating.  
   
 

### 00:13:27

   
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah, that's what I'm I mean there is space.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** For example, you could add more stuff at the bottom. It's very conceptual as you can see.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah. Yeah. You'd have to see some real data in it really,  
**Fede Carbo:** But  
**Jo Oliveira:** wouldn't you, to to get a feel for if it flows well.  
**Fede Carbo:** but that's why I need you to tell me like like how  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** how can I bring this to life so that you can later on see it and you're like oh you know this is crap or this is nice. Um, but maybe I mean with with these few points I could try and recreate something and maybe I can and maybe we can do like a a little check checkpoint and I can show you.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah, sounds  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah. Nice.  
**Jo Oliveira:** good.  
**Fede Carbo:** Cool. Anything else that we might be missing?  
**Jo Oliveira:** Um, no, I think that that's a good that's a good start. I say start.  
**Fede Carbo:** Oh,  
   
 

### 00:14:40

   
**Jo Oliveira:** I know you've been working on it a  
**Fede Carbo:** maybe maybe a notes one,  
**Jo Oliveira:** while.  
**Fede Carbo:** right? I'm assuming.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yes.  
**Fede Carbo:** Oh, look. It's adding them here. Yeah, it's super clunky, but  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah. What else do I have currently that's useful? Um, yeah, we talked about workflow, but se sequencing is also if you're going to be doing like an automated campaign, it's not something that we're doing at the moment at Unbox, but I have done in the past.  
**Fede Carbo:** Nice.  
**Jo Oliveira:** had like um it's called marketing automation. You basically have the first have like a series of messages already drafted and when the person opens the first one or responds to the first one, it kind of triggers the next one on the sequence. Um yeah, it's something that I've just put on the back burner for now because  
**Fede Carbo:** I  
**Jo Oliveira:** um I'm trying a different approach, but it is an approach sales approach to have sort of an automated  
**Fede Carbo:** mean, so I wonder if Yeah,  
   
 

### 00:15:48

   
**Jo Oliveira:** thing.  
**Fede Carbo:** again this concept is not perfect, but I wonder if there's like some kind of like page where you can manage that kind of like se sequential  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yes, you wouldn't want it automated.  
**Fede Carbo:** thing,  
**Jo Oliveira:** you'd want to really carefully manage something like that. I mean,  
**Fede Carbo:** right?  
**Jo Oliveira:** when I say automated, I wouldn't want AI to go off and do it or you'd want  
**Fede Carbo:** No,  
**Jo Oliveira:** to  
**Fede Carbo:** but it's it's it's like your it's like your campaign. Um, it's like it it helps you,  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** I guess, create it and have it.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** Um, yeah. Okay. Okay. I'll see if I can do something. I think I have some good material. So,  
**Jo Oliveira:** Okay.  
**Fede Carbo:** I'll just show you when there's a bit more and then we can iterate and make changes. This is this concept is to bring it to life,  
**Jo Oliveira:** Okay.  
**Fede Carbo:** I guess, right?  
**Jo Oliveira:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** But I'm sure it has many flaws.  
**Jo Oliveira:** How much time are you dedicating each week to this project? Is it just like one day a week or something?  
**Fede Carbo:** two days, but it yeah, it's two days based on the budget, but but I guess in certain weeks I take a bit longer or or I shorten it  
**Jo Oliveira:** H  
**Fede Carbo:** a bit. I I guess it's two days is within the average.  
**Jo Oliveira:** about Yeah.  
**Fede Carbo:** Uh but it's kind of flexible.  
**Jo Oliveira:** Okay.  
**Fede Carbo:** Yeah.  
**Jo Oliveira:** All right. Well, I look forward to hearing or seeing the next step. Just give me a shout if you need anything in between, though. Yeah. All right. No worries. Thanks, B. See you later. Bye. Bye.
